* TODO Deal with the verbose output of EmbeddedMongo
* TODO Don't like the name testurlcollectioninteraction
* TODO only launch the EmbeddedMongo once to make the testrun faster
* TODO urlsCollection is not really a collection

* Sparkpart
** TODO rest call to add a url
** TODO info on how to use the api
** TODO adding urls shall only be possible with identification

* ISSUE
the rest assured tests need to also add data to the embedded mongo and then try
to get them via the rest api. we can't use data created by other tests or the
atomic restraint wont work

CURRENT
