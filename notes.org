* TODO Deal with the verbose output of EmbeddedMongo
* DONE Don't like the name testurlcollectioninteraction
* TODO only launch the EmbeddedMongo once to make the testrun faster
* DONE urlsCollection is not really a collection

* TODO dont use test as databasename, dont use hardcoded at all
* TODO use gson for json serialising
** i can't really compare strings if the key:values in a json object are not ordered
* Sparkpart
** TODO rest call to add a url
** TODO info on how to use the api
** TODO adding urls shall only be possible with identification

* ISSUE
the rest assured tests need to also add data to the embedded mongo and then try
to get them via the rest api. we can't use data created by other tests or the
atomic restraint wont work

CURRENT
add request body bei restassured
